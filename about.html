  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p >Hi, my name is Connor Zittrauer. I have a passion for electronic music of all genres. But to be specific,
        I have a particular affinity for <i>ambient</i> music. Ambient is a form of electronic music that is 
        less concerned with the traditional elements of electronic like drums, bass, or vocals. Ambient is 
        more concerned with texture and style. While ambient music can have melody, it's often not the forefront
        of the piece. With an emphasis on repition and style, ambient music is great for studying, meditation,
        or any other concentrative task. A few of my favorite pieces include "dlp1.1" by William Basinski and
        "Thursday Afternoon" by Brian Eno. <br /><br/>
        
      
        This website provides an introduction into ambient music and offers brief descriptions of each subgenre. 
        If you check out the product page, you can find some links to purchase some of my hand selected, quality 
        guaranteed ambient albums. Thanks for stopping by!
