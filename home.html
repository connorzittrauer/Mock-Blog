        <h1>Ambient Music: Describing the Indescribable</h1>

        <p>Ambient music is a genre of music that emphasizes tone and atmosphere over 
           traditional musical structure or rhythm. A form of instrumental music, it may 
           lack net composition, beat, or structured melody. It uses textural layers 
           of sound which can reward both passive and active listening and encourage 
           a sense of calm or contemplation. The genre is said to evoke an "atmospheric", 
           "visual", or "unobtrusive" quality. Nature soundscapes may be included, 
           and the sounds of acoustic instruments such as the piano, strings and flute 
           may be emulated through a synthesizer. The genre originated in the 1960s 
           and 1970s, when new musical instruments were being introduced to a wider market, 
           such as the synthesizer. It was presaged by Erik Satie's furniture music and 
           styles such as Jamaican dub music and German electronic music, but was 
           prominently named and popularized by British musician Brian Eno in 1978 with 
           his album Ambient 1: Music for Airports; Eno opined that ambient music 
           "must be as ignorable as it is interesting." It saw a revival towards 
           the late 1980s with the prominence of house and techno music, growing a cult 
           following by the 1990s. Ambient music may have elements of new-age music 
           and drone music, as some works may use sustained or repeated notes.
           Ambient music did not achieve large commercial success, being criticized
           as having a "boring" and "over-intellectual" sound. 
           Nevertheless, it has attained a certain degree of acclaim throughout 
           the years, especially in the Internet age. Due to its relatively open style, 
           ambient music often takes influences from many other genres, ranging from 
           classical, avant-garde music, folk, jazz, and world music, amongst others.</p>

        <h1>Brian Eno: </h1>
        <img src="images/airports.jpg" width="350" height="350" alt="music for airports">
        <p>Eno is often considered the father of ambient music, and the album that really 
           earned him that reputation was 1978’s Music for Airports. The album consisted 
           of four sparse tracks, and was essentially intended to blend into the atmosphere 
           of wherever it was being played. True to its name, it actually was played at 
           New York’s LaGuardia Airport in the early 1980s. This was the album that officially 
           made ambient music a thing, but throughout his career, Eno made several other 
           albums that would come to define the genre. One of Eno’s most impressive — 
           and best known — ambient works is 1983’s Apollo: Soundtracks and Stories. 
           This was a soundtrack album originally made for a film about the Apollo missions 
           to the moon. The movie was eventually re-titled For All Mankind, and would use 
           some of the tracks from the album. Really, though, the album has taken on a life 
           independent from the film, and it’s one of most beautiful albums. The song 
           “An Ending (Ascent)” in particular, is indicative of what Eno was able to create 
           within the ambient realm.</p>
        <h1>William Basinski</h1>
        <img src="images/92982.jpg" width="350" height="350" alt="william basinski">
        <p>William Basinski is an experimental composer, sound sculptor, and video artist 
           based in Los Angeles, California. He is a relentless experimentalist obsessed with 
           reel-to-reel tape decks, splicing tape and spindling it. His musical signature 
           is evidenced, interestingly enough, by deeply emotional sounds filled with multiple 
           tones, drones, textures, and shades that are as hauntingly beautiful as they are somber. 
           While he's best-recognized for his career-defining 2002 album The Disintegration Loops, 
           Basinski recorded and released new music prolifically, expanding on his beautiful and 
           emotionally resonant sounds with albums like 2020's mournful Lamentations.
           Basinski is a classically trained musician. He was born in Houston and undertook 
           his first musical studies on the clarinet at Richardson High School -- an instrument 
           he continues to play. Upon graduation, he studied saxophone and composition at North 
           Texas State University. A teacher introduced him to the music of John Cage, which proved 
           influential. A little later, he encountered Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians and 
           Brian Eno's Music for Airports, and the first two albums by Fripp and Eno. Influenced by 
           tape loops and delay, Basinski began his own experimentation, putting a piece 
           of cellophane tape over the erase head of a Sony Walkman, then dubbing his own 
           compositions played on electric piano. He furthered these on two full-sized reel-to-reel 
           decks that he continues to use.

			<dt><strong>Dark Ambient</strong></dt>
			<dd>
				Brian Eno's original vision of ambient music as 
				unobtrusive musical wallpaper, later fused with 
				warm house rhythms and given playful qualities by 
				the Orb in the 1990s, found its opposite in the style

			</dd>
			<br />
			<dt><strong>Ambient Techno</strong></dt>
			<dd>
				Ambient techno is a music category emerging in the late 
				1980s that is used to describe ambient music atmospheres 
				with the rhythmic and melodic elements of techno.

			<br />
			<dt><strong>Space Music</strong></dt>
			<dd>
				Space music, also spelled "Spacemusic", includes music from 
				the ambient genre as well as a broad range of other genres with 
				certain characteristics in common to create the experience of 
				contemplative spaciousness.
			</dd>
			<br />
            <dt><strong>Ambient pop</strong></dt>
			<dd>
                Ambient pop is an extension of dream pop, possessing a shape and 
                form common to conventional pop, while its electronic textures 
                and atmospheres mirror the meditative qualities of ambient. It is 
                influenced by the lock-groove melodies of krautrock, but is less 
                abrasive.
			</dd>
			<br />
            <dt><strong>Ambient house</strong></dt>
			<dd>
                Ambient house is a musical category founded in the late 1980s that 
                is used to describe acid house featuring ambient music elements and 
                atmospheres. Tracks in the ambient house genre typically feature 
                four-on-the-floor beats, synth pads, and vocal samples integrated 
                in an atmospheric style. Ambient house tracks generally lack a 
                diatonic center and feature much atonality along with synthesized chords. 
                The Dutch Brainvoyager is an example of this genre. Illbient is 
                another form of ambient house music.
			</dd>
			<br />
            <dt><strong>Ambient Industrial</strong></dt>
			<dd>
                Ambient industrial is a hybrid genre of industrial and ambient
                music; the term industrial being used in the original experimental 
                sense, rather than in the sense of industrial metal.[51] A "typical" 
                ambient industrial work (if there is such a thing) might consist 
                of evolving dissonant harmonies of metallic drones and resonances, 
                extreme low frequency rumbles and machine noises, perhaps supplemented 
                by gongs, percussive rhythms, bullroarers, distorted voices or 
                anything else the artist might care to sample (often processed to 
                the point where the original sample is no longer recognizable). 
                Entire works may be based on radio telescope recordings, the babbling
                of newborn babies, or sounds recorded through contact microphones on 
                telegraph wires.
